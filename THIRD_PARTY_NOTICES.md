# Third-party notices

This payload was developed as part of the author's CivSwitchFS research. It
builds on techniques and prior work from the following projects.

## CivSwitch

- Project: CivSwitch (Switch 1/2 Civilization VII userland exploit and Remote
  JS Loader)
- Author: Gezine
- License: MIT
- Copyright: Copyright (c) 2026 Gezine

The payload runs inside the CivSwitch Remote JS Loader and relies on the loader
core it initializes (`sdk_base`, `call_rop`, memory helpers, logging, and the
remote JavaScript transport). The core helpers in `src/core/` were written for
this research, but their execution environment and several low-level patterns
come from CivSwitch.

The optional persistence build composes this payload with the full CivSwitch
bootstrap and stage decoder in `persist/`. Generated images
include both MIT license notices.

## Persistent installer components

The persistence codec, SDK-backed save writer, and installer in `persist/`
are adapted from Gezine's MIT-licensed persistent installer. They replace the
`XSTRIG.Civ7Save` trigger with the generated standalone image. The bootstrap,
stage decoder, and pristine trigger template are included directly in
`persist/`; the template is not a personal game save. Their fingerprints are
checked at build time. See `persist/LICENSE` for the bootstrap's MIT notice.

## CivSwitch ns2jb port

- Project: CivSwitch ns2jb → FS-acquisition port (fork of CivSwitch)
- Author: Slapah
- Repository: no longer available; the original repository no longer exists
- License: MIT
- Copyright: Copyright (c) 2026 Gezine

This project reuses the ns2jb reserved-gap acquisition idea and reference
shape checks documented by that port. The implementation in `src/core/` is an
independent adaptation for this payload; no third-party source tree is
vendored here.

## ns2jb

- Project: [ns2jb on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/kurumuz/ns2jb)
- Author: Kurumuz ([GitLab profile](https://gitlab.com/kurumuz))
- License: no license file was present in the reference checkout used during
  the research; this describes the inspected checkout, not necessarily the
  current state of the GitLab project

Only the documented technique (reserved-gap allocator race) and publicly
described behavior were used. No ns2jb source code is included.
